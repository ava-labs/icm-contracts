# Contracts

This directory contains Solidity contracts that leverage Avalanche Interchain Messaging (ICM) to implement unique cross-chain functions.

This repository is set up as a [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry) project. Use the `scripts/install_foundry.sh` to install the correct version of Foundry.

## Building and Running

- To compile the contracts run `forge build` from this directory.
- Similarly, to run unit tests, run `forge test`.
- See additional testing and deployment options [here](https://book.getfoundry.sh/forge/).

## Generate documentation

- Documentation can be generated by running `forge doc --build` from this repository. By default, this will generate documentation to `contracts/docs/`, and an HTML book to `contracts/docs/book/`. It's also possible to serve this book locally by running `forge doc --serve <PORT>`.

## Audits

In general, the contracts in this repository have been audited. Any contracts that have not undergone at least one audit will be explicitly marked as such. Please note that audits capture the state of code at a point in time, and the code is subject to change in the meantime. Please check [here](../audits/README.md) for the full list of audits.
